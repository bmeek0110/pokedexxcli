# pokedexxcli

Exploringing all of the pokemon regions, catching pokemon, getting spooky, and making my babe proud one eevee at a time!

 - To launch run ./pokedexxcli to enter the command line, and then you can run the below commands.

Here are your available commands:
 - pokedex: View all of the pokemon in your pokedex
 - exit: Turns off the Pokedex
 - help: Prints the help menu
 - map: Lists the next page of location areas
 - mapb: Lists the previous page of location areas
 - explore {location_area}: Lists the pokemon in a location area
 - catch {pokemon_name}: Attempt to catch a pokemon and add it to your pokedex
 - inspect {pokemon_name}: View information about a caught pokemon

Updates coming soon:
- Update the CLI to support the "up" arrow to cycle through previous commands
- Simulate battles between pokemon
- Add more unit tests
- Refactor your code to organize it better and make it more testable
- Keep pokemon in a "party" and allow them to level up
- Allow for pokemon that are caught to evolve after a set amount of time
- Persist a user's Pokedex to disk so they can save progress between sessions
- Use the PokeAPI to make exploration more interesting. For example, rather than typing the names of areas, maybe you are given choices of areas and just type "left" or "right"
- Random encounters with wild pokemon
- Adding support for different types of balls (Pokeballs, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, etc), which have different chances of catching pokemon
